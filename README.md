# Java And Js' NotificationCenter
We all know that observer pattern is a very userful design pattern in programing. But the implementation   
of java is not convenient at sometimes, because we must to extend from observable and implement observer.   
I think IOS' NSNotificationCenter is a good way to implement observer pattern, so I implement it with    
java and js just like IOS' NSNotificationCenter. I hope some day I will use these codes.
